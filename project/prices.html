On the homepage their are social media website links that provide more information about the club. Also on the homepage, the images on the slideshow make sound if you click on them. Each picture makes a different sound. In the table on my homepage there lists links to my other websites. The first link has information on what the club is about and when it starts. The second one shows prices and merchandise sold. The third one has a calender for events and important dates. The last link talks about what sports are included. Note (for Mr.Simonsen): Creating a website was a bit difficult at first, but I learned many useful coding tricks. While designing my website, I basically learned how to manage and type all the requirements needed for designing a website (adding images, creating links, embedding files, etc.). I also learned a few extra things that have made my website stand out like fancy backgrounds, slideshows, buttons, etc. This project gave me a really fun and interesting experience, along with the idea that I might start considering a career in computers.';
